## Graph-based methods for change detection in remote sensing images

This repository contains both several methods and demo experiments to perform semisupervised change detection of remote sensing images on graphs. Some of them are inspired in our recent paper: 

1. **Graph Learning Based on Signal Smoothness Representation for Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Change Detection.**

Documentation and code improvements are still in progress.
